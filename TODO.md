# QUESTIONS

- placeholder sqlite vs mysql
- Bridges - ajax or page-reload (Is it safe to cookie a jwt via js?)
- - Return the encrypted jwt as a string, asign it with js
- Can i return the result of an INSERT query
- - A user can have 1 session pr browser so i cant just get session matching user_id

# TODDO

- ROUTES
- - sign_up_get
- - / - (if jwt = signed in, else preview only and link to sign-up/in)
